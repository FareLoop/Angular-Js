It is one of India’s largest cities and one of its major ports. The city is centred on the east bank of the Hugli (Hooghly) River, once the main channel of the Ganges (Ganga) River, about 96 miles (154 km) upstream from the head of the Bay of Bengal; there the port city developed as a point of transshipment from water to land and from river to sea.</p><img ng-src=\"img/victoria.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"400px\" style=\"margin-left:160px;\"><p style=\"padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"> A city of commerce, transport, and manufacture, Kolkata is the dominant urban centre of eastern India. The city’s former name, Calcutta, is an Anglicized version of the Bengali name Kalikata. According to some, Kalikata is derived from the Bengali word Kalikshetra, meaning “Ground of (the goddess) Kali.” Some say the city’s name derives from the location of its original settlement on the bank of a canal (khal). A third opinion traces it to the Bengali words for lime (calcium oxide; kali) and burnt shell (kata), since the area was noted for the manufacture of shell lime. In 2001 the government of West Bengal officially changed the name of the city to Kolkata. Area city, 40 square miles (104 square km); urban agglom., 533 square miles (1,380 square km). Pop.

Kolkata has had to assimilate strong European influences and overcome the limitations of its colonial legacy in order to find its own unique identity. In the process it created an amalgam of East and West that found its expression in the life and works of the 19th-century Bengali elite and its most noteworthy figure, the poet and mystic Rabindranath Tagore.</p>"

                template :  "<h1><u>Landscape></u></h1><h2>City Site:</h2><p style=\"padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"> The location of the city appears to have been originally selected partly because of its easily defensible position and partly because of its favourable trading location. The low, swampy, hot, and humid riverbank otherwise has little to recommend it. Its maximum elevation is about 30 feet (9 metres) above sea level. Eastward from the river the land slopes away to marshes and swamplands. Similar topography on the west bank of the river has confined the metropolitan area largely to a strip 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 km) wide on either bank of the river. Reclamation of the Salt Lake area on the northeastern fringe of the city, however, demonstrated that the spatial expansion of the city is feasible, and further reclamation projects have been undertaken to the east, south, and west of the central area.Suburbs of Kolkata include Haora (Howrah) on the west bank, Baranagar to the north, South Dum Dum to the northeast, Behala to the south, and Garden Reach in the southwest. The whole urban complex is held together by close socioeconomic ties.</p><h2>Climate :</h2><p>Kolkata has a subtropical climate with a seasonal regime of monsoons (rain-bearing winds). It is warm year-round, with average high temperatures ranging from about 80 °F (27 °C) in December and January to nearly 100 °F (38 °C) in April and May. The average annual rainfall is about 64 inches (1,625 mm). Most of this falls from June to September, the period of the monsoon. These months are very humid and sometimes sultry. During October and November the rainfall dwindles. The winter months, from about the end of November to the end of February, are pleasant and rainless; fogs and mists occasionally reduce visibility in the early morning hours at this season, as also do thick blankets of smog in the evenings. The atmospheric pollution has greatly increased since the early 1950s. Factories, motor vehicles, and thermal-generating stations, which burn coal, are primary causes of this pollution, but monsoon winds act as cleansing agents by bringing in fresh air masses and also hastening the removal of water pollution.</p>"

                template : "<h1><u>People</u></h1><p style=\"padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\">More than four-fifths of the population is Hindu. Muslims and Christians constitute the largest minorities, but there are some Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists. The dominant language is Bengali, but Urdu, Oriya, Tamil, Punjabi, and other languages also are spoken. Kolkata is a cosmopolitan city: other than Indians, groups present include a variety of peoples from elsewhere in Asia (notably Bangladeshis and Chinese), Europeans, North Americans, and Australians. Kolkata was segregated under British rule, the Europeans living in the city centre and Indians living to the north and south. The pattern of segregation has continued in the modern city, although the distribution is now based on religious, linguistic, educational, and economic criteria. Shantytowns and low-income residential areas, however, exist side-by-side with more affluent areas.</p><img ng-src=\"img/festival.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"400px\" style=\"margin-left:160px;\"><p>The density of population is extremely high, and overcrowding has reached virtually intolerable proportions in many sections of the city. Kolkata experienced a high rate of population growth for more than a century, and events such as the partitioning of Bengal in 1947 and warfare in Bangladesh in the early 1970s precipitated massive population influxes. Large refugee colonies also have sprung up in the northern and southern suburbs. In addition, a great number of migrants from other states—mostly from neighbouring Bihar and Orissa and eastern Uttar Pradesh—have come to Kolkata in search of employment.</p>"

Among the products of Kolkata’s hinterland have been coal, iron, manganese, mica, petroleum, tea, and jute. Unemployment, however, has been a continuing and growing problem since the 1950s.</p><br><h2 style=\"padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\">Manufacturing:</h2 style=\"padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\"><p>Kolkata is the centre of India’s large jute-processing industry. The jute industry was established in the 1870s, and mills now extend north and south of the city centre on both banks of the Hugli River. Engineering constitutes the city’s other major industry. In addition, city factories produce and distribute a variety of consumer goods—notably foodstuffs, beverages, tobacco, and textiles—other light manufactures, and chemicals. Kolkata’s industries have been in a general decline since Indian independence in 1947. Major factors contributing to this decline have been the loss of the eastern part of Bengal at independence, an overall decline in Kolkata’s industrial productivity, and the lack of industrial diversification in the city.</p><br><h2 style=\"padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\" >Finance, trade, and other services:</h2><p style=\"padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\">The Kolkata stock exchange plays an important part in the organized financial market of the country. Foreign banks also have a significant business base in Kolkata, although the city’s importance as an international banking centre has declined. In addition, coal mines, jute mills, and large-scale engineering industries are controlled from offices in the city. State and national chambers of commerce are based in Kolkata as well.The mercantile nature of the city’s economy is reflected in the fact that about two-fifths of the workers are employed in trade and commerce. Other important occupations include public-sector service in government departments, financial institutions, and medical and educational institutions. Private-sector services include the stock exchange, medical and educational services, legal services, accountancy and credit firms, and various utility services.</p><br><h2 style=\"padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\">Transportation:</h2><p style=\"padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\">The condition of the surfaced roads in the city is poor, although the traffic load is heavy. The mass transit system features numerous trams and buses, some under government management and others run by private companies. In 1986 the first section of a subway system—the first in India—was opened in the city. By the early 21st century it was the primary means of commuting within the city, with almost two million commuters using it every day.<img ng-src=\"img/howrah.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"400px\" style=\"margin-left:160px;\"><p style=\"padding-left:10px;margin-left:20px;\">The connection between Kolkata and its hinterland to the west depends upon several bridges over the Hugli—those linked to Haora and, farther north, the bridges at Bally and Naihati. The main Haora bridge, Rabindra Setu, carries multiple lanes of vehicular traffic and is one of the most heavily used bridges in the world. Two additional bridges between Kolkata and Haora, Vidyasagar Setu and Nivedita Setu, have eased traffic on the main bridge.The Grand Trunk Road, a national highway, is one of the oldest road routes in India. It runs through Haora to Pakistan and is the main route connecting the city with northern India. National highways also connect Kolkata with the west coast of India, the northern part of West Bengal, and the frontier with Bangladesh.Two railway terminals—Haora on the west bank and Sealdah on the east—serve the railway networks running north and south as well as those running east and west. Kolkata’s major air terminal, at Dum Dum, handles international and domestic flights.The Kolkata port lost its position as India’s preeminent cargo handler in the 1960s, but it and the port of Haldia (about 40 miles [65 km] downstream) still account for a large portion of the country’s foreign exchange. The decline in traffic occurred partly because of problems encountered in dredging silt from the river and partly because of labour difficulties. Transport, storage, wholesaling, and retailing requirements for exports and imports are concentrated in Kolkata and Haora.</p> "

The council members annually elect a mayor, a deputy mayor, and a number of committees to conduct the activities of the corporation. A commissioner, the executive head of the corporation, is responsible to its elected membership. The city is also a part of the Kolkata Metropolitan District, an entity created to oversee planning and development on a regional basis. This district includes a large rural hinterland around the urban centres.<br>Because Kolkata is the capital of the state of West Bengal, the governor resides in the city in the historic Raj Bhavan. The state Legislative Assembly is located in the city, as is the Secretariat, housed in the Writers’ Building, with the state ministries in charge of various departments. The Kolkata High Court, exercising original jurisdiction over the city and appellate jurisdiction over West Bengal, is also located there. A number of national government institutions—including the National Library, the Indian Museum, and the Geological Survey of India—are in the city as well.</p><h2>Municipal Services:</h2><p>Filtered water is supplied from the main waterworks located outside the city at Palta, as well as from some 200 major wells and 3,000 smaller ones. The Farakka Barrage (dam) on the Ganges, 240 miles (386 km) upriver from Kolkata, ensures a generally saline-free water supply for the city, but because existing water supplies are inadequate, salinity continues to be a problem during the dry months. In addition, unfiltered water, supplied daily for watering the city streets and for the fire brigade, is used by many residents for their daily needs. This circumstance was largely responsible for the former prevalence of cholera during the summer months, but chlorination of unfiltered water and cholera inoculation have reduced considerably the occurrence of the disease.<br>Municipal Kolkata has several hundred miles of sewers and surface drains, but much of the city remains unsupplied with sewers. Accumulation of silt has narrowed many sewer channels. The system of removing garbage and of garbage dumping is also unsatisfactory.<br>Kolkata is supplied with electricity by a variety of sources. There is still a gap, however, between generating capacity and potential demand, and temporary power interruptions occur on occasion.<br>Administration of the Kolkata police force is vested in the city’s commissioner of police, as is direction of the suburban police force. The city is divided into a number of police precincts. The fire brigade has its headquarters in central Kolkata.</p><h2>Health:</h2><p>Hundreds of hospitals, private clinics, free dispensaries run by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and charitable trusts, and state-operated polyclinics serve the Kolkata region. The number of doctors per 1,000 persons is greater in Kolkata than in most parts of the country, but their distribution is uneven; since the city is a medical centre for the northeastern region of India, its health-care facilities are always overcrowded. The Order of the Missionaries of Charity, an organization founded (1948) by Mother Teresa (recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize of 1979), cares for the blind, the elderly, the dying, and people afflicted with leprosy in the poorest sections of the city. There are several medical colleges, in addition to other medical research centres.</p><img ng-src=\"img/mother.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"400px\" style=\"margin-left:160px;\"><h2>Education:</h2><p>Education has long been a mark of higher social status in Kolkata. The city has been a centre of learning since the resurgence in Indian education that began in Bengal in the early 19th century.

Most secondary schools are under the supervision of the state, but some are accredited through the national government.<br>Kolkata has three major universities: the University of Calcutta, Jadavpur University, and Rabindra Bharati University. The University of Calcutta, founded in 1857, has more than 150 affiliated colleges. Besides these colleges, university colleges of arts (humanities), commerce, law, medicine, science, and technology specialize in postgraduate teaching and research. Jadavpur University (1955) has faculties in the arts (humanities), science, and engineering. Although the university has a small number of colleges affiliated with it, its main focus is on graduate and postgraduate instruction on a single campus. Rabindra Bharati University (1962), founded in honour of Rabindranath Tagore, specializes in humanities and the fine arts (dance, drama, and music).<br>Research institutions include the Indian Statistical Institute, the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, the Bose Institute (natural science), and the All-India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, which is a constituent college of the University of Calcutta.</p>"

The city is the birthplace of modern Indian literary and artistic thought and of Indian nationalism, and its citizens have made great efforts to preserve Indian culture and civilization. The blending of Eastern and Western cultural influences over the centuries has stimulated the creation of numerous and diverse organizations that contribute to Kolkata’s cultural life. In addition to the universities, these include the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Bengal Literary Society (Bangiya Sahitya Parishad), the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, the Academy of Fine Arts, the Birla Academy of Art and Culture, and the Maha Bodhi Society.<img ng-src=\"img/asiatic.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"400px\" style=\"margin-left:160px;\"><p style=\"text-align:center;\">siatic Society of Bengal headquarters, Kolkata </p><br><h2>Museums and Libraries:</h2><p>Greater Kolkata has more than 30 museums, which cover a wide variety of fields.

The exhibits at Victoria Memorial Hall trace Britain’s relations with India. The Asutosh Museum of Indian Art in the University of Calcutta has exhibits of the folk art of Bengal among its collections. Science City, a large science museum and entertainment complex, was among the first of its kind in Asia. Valuable library collections are to be found in the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Bengal Literary Society, and the University of Calcutta; the National Library is the largest in India and contains a fine collection of rare books and manuscripts.<img ng-src=\"img/indian.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"400px\" style=\"margin-left:160px;\"><p style=\"text-align:center;\">Indian Museum</p><h2>The arts:</h2><p>Kolkatans have long been active in literary and artistic pursuits. The city saw the dawn of the mid-19th-century literary movement that sparked a cultural renaissance throughout India. The best exponent of this movement was Rabindranath Tagore, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature of 1913, whose remarkable creativity in poetry, music, drama, and painting continues to enrich the cultural life of the city. Kolkata remains at the vanguard of artistic movements in the country, and several artists’ societies present annual shows.<br>Kolkata is also a centre of traditional and contemporary music and dance. In 1934 Tagore inaugurated the first All-Bengal Music Conference in Kolkata. Since then, a number of classical Indian music conferences have been held every year. The home of many classical dancers, Kolkata was the location of Uday Shankar’s experiments at adapting Western theatrical techniques to traditional dance forms. The school of dance, music, and drama founded by him has been in the city since 1965.<br>Professional drama got its start in Kolkata in the 1870s with the founding of the National Theatre (later replaced by the Minerva Theatre). Modern dramatic forms were pioneered in the city by such playwrights as Girish Chandra Ghosh and Dirabandhu Mitra. Kolkata is still an important centre of professional and amateur theatre and of experimental drama. The city also has been a pioneering centre of motion-picture production in India. The avant-garde film directors Satyajit Ray and Mrinal Sen have achieved international acclaim. There are scores of cinemas in the city, which regularly show films in English, Bengali, and Hindi.</p><h2>Recreation</h2><p>More than 200 parks, squares, and open spaces are maintained by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. There is, however, very little open space in the overcrowded parts of the city. The Maidan, about 1,000 acres (400 hectares) in area, is the best-known open space; the major football (soccer), cricket, and hockey fields are located there. Adjacent to the Maidan is one of the oldest cricket fields in the world, Ranji Stadium, in the Eden Gardens; Netaji Stadium, for indoor events, is also in the vicinity. The Salt Lake Stadium, built to the east of the city, can seat 100,000 spectators. There are racecourses and golf courses within the city, and rowing at the Lake Club and the Bengal Rowing Club is popular. The Zoological Gardens are spread over an area of some 40 acres (16 hectares).

                template : "<h1><u>History</u></h1><h2>The early period:</h2><p>The name Kalikata was mentioned in the rent-roll of the Mughal emperor Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) and also in the Manasa-mangal of the Bengali poet Bipradas (1495). The history of Kolkata as a British settlement, known to the British as Calcutta, dates from the establishment of a trading post there by Job Charnock, an agent of the English East India Company, in 1690.<br>Charnock had previously had disputes with officials of the Mughal Empire at the river port of Hugli (Hooghly) and had been obliged to leave, after which he attempted unsuccessfully to establish himself at other places down the river. When the Mughal officials, not wishing to lose what they had gained from the English company’s commerce, permitted Charnock to return once more, he chose Calcutta as the seat of his operations. The site was apparently carefully selected, being protected by the Hugli (Hooghly) River on the west, a creek to the north, and salt lakes to the east. Rival Dutch, French, and other European settlements were higher up the river on the west bank, so that access from the sea was not threatened, as it was at the port of Hugli. The river at this point was also wide and deep; the only disadvantage was that the marshes to the east and swamps within the area made the spot unhealthy. Moreover, before the coming of the English, three local villages—Sutanati, Kalikata, and Gobindapore, which were later to become parts of Calcutta—had been chosen as places to settle by Indian merchants who had migrated from the silted-up port of Satgaon, farther upstream. The presence of these merchants may have been to some extent responsible for Charnock’s choice of the site.<br>By 1696, when a rebellion broke out in the nearby district of Burdwan, the Mughal provincial administration had become friendly to the growing settlement. The servants of the company, who asked for permission to fortify their trading post, or factory, were given permission in general terms to defend themselves. The rebels were easily crushed by the Mughal government, but the settlers’ defensive structure of brick and mud remained and came to be known as Fort William. In 1698 the English obtained letters patent that granted them the privilege of purchasing the zamindari right (the right of revenue collection; in effect, the ownership) of the three villages. This area around Fort William—Calcutta—became the seat of the British province known as the Bengal Presidency.</p><h2>Growth of the city:</h2><p>In 1717 the Mughal emperor Farrukh-Siyar granted the East India Company freedom of trade in return for a yearly payment of 3,000 rupees; this arrangement gave a great impetus to the growth of Calcutta. A large number of Indian merchants flocked to the city. The servants of the company, under the company’s flag, carried on a duty-free private trade. When the Marathas from the southwest began incursions against the Mughals in the western districts of Bengal in 1742, the English obtained permission from ʿAlī Vardī Khan, the nawab (ruler) of Bengal, to dig an entrenchment in the northern and eastern part of the town to form a moat on the land side. This came to be known as the Maratha Ditch. Although it was not completed to the southern end of the settlement, it marked the city’s eastern boundary.<br>In 1756 the nawab’s successor, Sirāj al-Dawlah, captured the fort and sacked the town. A number of Europeans were imprisoned in a small lockup popularly known as the Black Hole of Calcutta, and many died. Calcutta was recaptured in January 1757 by Robert Clive, one of the founders of British power in India, and by the British admiral Charles Watson. The nawab was defeated shortly afterward at Plassey (June 1757), after which British rule in Bengal was assured. Gobindapore was cleared of its forests, and the new Fort William was built on its present site, overlooking the Hugli at Calcutta, where it became the symbol of British military ascendancy.</p><h2>Capital of British India:</h2><p>Calcutta did not become the capital of British India until 1772, when the first governor-general, Warren Hastings, transferred all important offices to the city from Murshidabad, the provincial Mughal capital. In 1773 Bombay (now Mumbai) and Madras (now Chennai) became subordinate to the government at Fort William. A supreme court administering English law began to exercise original jurisdiction over the city as far as the Maratha Ditch (now Acharya Prafulla Chandra and Jagadish Chandra Bose roads).<br>In 1706 the population of Calcutta was roughly between 10,000 and 12,000. It increased to nearly 120,000 by 1752 and to 180,000 by 1821. The White (British) Town was built on ground that had been raised and drained. There were so many palaces in the British sector of the city that it was named the “city of palaces.” Outside the British town were built the mansions of the newly rich, as well as clusters of huts. The names of different quarters of the city—such as Kumartuli (the potters’ district) and Sankaripara (the conch-shell workers’ district)—still indicate the various occupational castes of the people who became residents of the growing metropolis. Two distinct areas—one British, one Indian—came to coexist in Calcutta.<br>Calcutta at that time was described as a pestilential town. There were few good roads. In 1814 the Lottery Committee was constituted to finance public improvement by means of lotteries, and between 1814 and 1836 it took some effective measures to improve conditions. The municipal corporation was established in 1841. Cyclones in 1864, 1867, and 1870, however, devastated the poorer, low-lying areas.<br>By successive stages, as British power extended over the subcontinent, the whole of northern India became a hinterland for the port of Calcutta. The abolition of inland customs duties in 1835 created an open market, and the construction of railways (beginning in 1854) further quickened the development of business and industry. It was at this time that the Grand Trunk Road from Calcutta to Peshawar (now in Pakistan) was completed. British mercantile, banking, and insurance interests flourished. The Indian sector of Calcutta also became a busy hub of commerce and was thronged with people from throughout India and many other parts of Asia. Calcutta became the intellectual centre of the subcontinent.</p><h2>Pre-independence troubles:</h2><p>The turn of the 20th century marked the beginning of a troublesome period for Calcutta. Lord Curzon, viceroy of India, partitioned Bengal in 1905, making Dacca (now Dhaka, Bangl.) the capital of eastern Bengal and Assam. Insistent agitation led to the annulment of this partition in 1911, but at that time the capital of British India was removed from Calcutta to Delhi, where the government could enjoy relative calm.</p><img ng-src=\"img/map.jpg\" width=\"800px\" height=\"400px\" style=\"margin-left:160px;\"><p style=\"text-align:center;\">Map of Kolkata(c.1900)</p><br><p>Meanwhile, as Calcutta’s population grew larger, social problems also became more insistent, as did demands for home rule for India. Communal riots occurred in 1926, and, when the nationalist leader Mohandas Gandhi called for noncompliance with unjust laws, riots occurred in 1930. In World War II, Japanese air raids upon the Calcutta docks caused damage and loss of life. The most serious communal riots of all took place in 1946, when the partition of British India became imminent and tensions between Muslims and Hindus reached their height.</p></br>"
